Rotation direction as seems from back side of motor!

Command protocol: [ addr command data ]
         broadcast addr: b
commands:
0/1 - command for given motor:
        E - get end-switches
        L - move CCW
        M - get motor state (RELAX, INFMV+/-, STOP, MVSTP+/-, OFFSW+/-, UNDEF)
        N - go for N st./get rest
        O - pull off the switch
        P - get current position
        R - move CW
        S - get/set speed
        X - stop motor
        Z - stop and zero position
r - reset MCU
G - get board address
L 0/1 - LED on/off
P ch val - PWM on channel ch
T - time counter value

examples:
[00E] -> [ 0 0 E 0 ]   (no esw)
[01E] -> [ 0 1 E 3 ]   (both - bad situation)
[00L] -> [ 0 0 L  ]    (all OK)
[01L] -> [ 0 1 L E 1 ] (on left endswitch)
[00R] -> [ 0 0 R E 2 ] (on right endswitch)
[01R][01M] -> [ 0 1 M INFMV+ ]
[01N400] -> [ 0 1 N 400 ] (start moving)
[01N] -> [ 0 1 N 46 ] (steps left)
[00N-300] -> [ 0 0 N err ] (on endswitch)
[00O-100] -> [ 0 0 O err ] (on left endswitch)
[00O100] -> [ 0 0 O 100 ] (on rigth endswitch or out of them)
[01P] -> [ 0 1 P 1903 ] (current position in full steps)
[00S] -> [ 0 0 S 2500 ] (get speed value)
[01S1500] -> [ 0 1 S 1500 ] (set speed value)
[01X] -> [ 0 1 X ]
[01Z] -> [ 0 1 Z ]
